== Description ==

= YOU MADE IT, WE KEEP IT SAFE! =

Protect your WordPress with malware scans; block bots & suspicious IPs. Get a complete [WordPress security toolkit](https://secupress.me/) for free or as a pro plugin.

**What’s the difference between free and pro version?**
If you are proactive, our free WordPress security plugin is a great choice! No time to activate weekly scans? Then [SecuPress pro](https://secupress.me/) is the way to go. Our plugin takes care of everything with automated tasks.

= Here are some of our most popular features: =

* Anti Brute Force login
* Blocked IPs
* Firewall
* Security alerts (1)
* Malware Scan (1)
* Block country by geolocation (1)

= We have included some features you won’t find in most WordPress security plugins: =

* Protection of Security Keys
* Block visits from Bad Bots
* Vulnerable Plugins & Themes detection (1)
* Security Reports in PDF format (1)

You can check out [Frequently Asked Questions](https://secupress.me/faq/) or get in touch with our [support](https://secupress.me/support/). Want to know all about SecuPress? You can read our documentation here: [docs.secupress.me](https://docs.secupress.me).

**How will you know it works?**
Well, we have a dedicated security scanner that will give you a clear security grade and report for your website. This way, you’ll know exactly what to fix.

= WordPress Features =

**Security Audit**
SecuPress is the only plugin with a full scanner able to fix the issues for you. And when it requires a decision from you, it will ask you before proceeding. With this feature, you can check 35 security points in 5 minutes and let us take care of the rest.

Once done, you get a security grade that gives you a clear idea of what your security level is. You can export this analysis in PDF format to share with others (clients or colleagues) (1).

**Users & Login**
This feature is the easiest way to make sure your users’ data is protected and to keep their accounts from being compromised. With this feature you can limit the number of bad login attempts, ban non-existing usernames login attempts and set a non-login time slot. SecuPress also makes sure you can avoid double logins and control your sessions.

SecuPress also adds a [2FA](https://secupress.me/blog/two-factor-authentication/) (Two Factor Authentication) because it’s almost a mandatory feature when it comes to WordPress security!

The plugin also gives you greater user and password control as you can set:

* Password lifetimes for your users.
* Enforce strong password use.
* Forbid the use of vague usernames like www or admin.

Tired of bots finding your WordPress login page? Finally, don't let bots find your login page, just move it with the famous Move Login plugin, now included in SecuPress.

**Plugins and Themes**
SecuPress helps you detect themes and plugins that are vulnerable or that have been tampered with to include malicious code. If you install one of these, your security module will send out an email alert and give you a warning in WordPress.

SecuPress takes security further by limiting plugin activation, deactivation, installation and removal in your production (live) website. Plugin and theme uploads via .zip files will be on lockdown as well to block off this easy hacking route.

**WordPress Core**
SecuPress reinforces the WordPress Core to keep it safe. The security plugin optimizes what’s under the hood to secure the config file by setting the proper parameters.

**Sensitive Data**
SecuPress secures content in many ways:

* The plugin secures WordPress Endpoints and APIs by blocking bad requests for XML-RPC or REST API.
* It blocks bad bots with its Robots Blackhole feature.
* It provides an anti-hotlink feature to preserve your bandwidth.
* The plugin packs 7 anti-disclose security modules to make sure no precious information is available to hackers in your PHP or WordPress itself.
* Profile and SecuPress settings pages are password protected to keep sensitive information away from prying eyes.

**Firewall**

* SecuPress is one of the most efficient WordPress bouncer you’ll ever see!
* The plugin blocks malicious incoming requests.
* It blocks bad User Agents (no bad crawlers allowed).
* Bad requests methods also get the boot in a single click.
* URLs are kept in check: no bad URL contents.
* SQL injection scanners are kept out as well.
* Brute force attempts are stopped in their tracks.
* GeoIP Blocking by country gives you more control over your traffic.

**Malware Scan**
SecuPress has a unique malware scan developed by our security experts. It hunts down bad files and provides you with an easy step-by-step report that lets you take action. It looks into:

* Bad files in your FTP.
* Your uploads folder for dangerous files.
* Potential phishing attempts via `index.php` loads.

**Backups**
We know firsthand how painful it is to pick up the pieces after an attack damages your WordPress. SecuPress preserves your data to help you avoid lost content or settings if your website comes under attack. The plugin backs up your database and files and lets you download them to guarantee you peace of mind.

**Anti Spam**
Did you know that 60% of the traffic on the Internet is generated by bots? Most of them happen to be spam bots. We developed our own anti-spam system that works quietly in the background. Just activate it and enjoy a spam free experience.

**Alerts**
Alerts are an essential tool when your website is under attack. When something important happens on your website, SecuPress will send you an alert via email. We’re working on alerts via SMS, Slack & Twitter as well.

You also receive a daily report that provides a debrief of the attempted attack and all the activities blocked by SecuPress.

**Scheduled Security Tasks**
SecuPress can run 3 separate scheduled tasks for you. It’s like having a security patrol on your WordPress.

**Scheduled Scanner:** SecuPress scans your website to detect any issues. After the scan is complete, you get a report in your inbox outlining any actions you have to take to protect your website.
**Scheduled Backup:** our team knows that everyone at one time or another forgets to back things up. We made it an automatic task to help ensure you always can recover from an attack with your content safe.
**Scheduled Malware Scan:** this security feature scans your website at regular intervals to hunt down any malware that may have gotten into your WordPress.

**Logs**
SecuPress will keep a log of important security activities and 404 pages triggered by users, bots or even Chuck Norris. This lets you keep an eye on what’s going on in your WordPress at any time. You can also control banned IPs from this option.

* New: some scans were slightly modified, so here is a new one that will test only the ShellShock vulnerability ヽ(´ー\`)人(´∇｀)人(\`Д´)ノ
* New: if a scan displays a "Not able to access your front page" message, it brings you the possibility to activate the protection anyway.
* Improvement #118: in the scanner's manual fixes, the "Ignore this step" button is more understandable.
* Improvement #147: in logs and alerts, no more "UAHE", "BUC", or any other obscur codes when a request is blocked, only a human readable sentence.
* Improvement #199: the User Agent blacklist is now case sensitive.
* Improvement #274: if you use a "Coming Soon" or "Maintenance" page, manual scans have now a small drill and can get through it and will no longer trigger a "Not able to access your front page" message for this reason.
* Improvement #286: updated the "no longer in directory" and "not updated over 2 years" plugins lists.
* Improvement #289: the scan message related to the constant `COOKIEHASH` is more accurate.
* Improvement #290: whitelisted IPs don't trigger alerts and logs when they are *not* blocked.
* Improvement #297: the checkbox to activate the protection to deny access to malicious file extensions in the uploads folder now displays rewrite rules if the configuration file is not writable.
* Improvement #324: tell cache plugins not to cache our blocking messages nor the login pages.
* Improvement: prevent our icons to be overridden by other plugins or themes.
* Fix #264: the scanner related to the admin user wouldn't fix anything in a specific case. Nothing is better than a whip sometimes.
* Fix #265: fixed a message displayed by the chmod scan. In some cases it was speaking nonsense about files `/` and `/`.
* Fix #281: "Ask for old password" and "Strong Passwords" are now besties （ ^_^）o自自o（^_^ ）
* Fix #285: typo in a `IfModule` (－‸ლ)
* Fix #291: the fix related to the WordPress version disclosure ate the rewrite rules on Nginx. So we made it give them back (that was kind of scary).


= 1.1.3 =

* 07 november 2016
* Improvement #258: Remove the blog_id and website URL in the new salt keys to avoid having to log in on each website on a multisite, was just annoying.
* Improvement #259: Better hook usage to allow any cache plugin (like WP Rocket of course) to ignore login page.
* Improvement #195: Better Move Login rules on Nginx. And better rules in general for all modules.
* Fix #262: Some firewall sub-modules are not working in front-end, the functions were not in the right file :|
* Fix #252: X-Powered by header was not hidden on Nginx.
* Fix #250: WPML still appeared as a "bad plugin removed from repo", well, the whitelist filter was not used.

* Fix #190: The module link in the non login time slot scan has now its # to get a correct anchor. Happy sailor.

* Fix #193: The anti-bruteforce scan always said "false" because we didn't call him by its real name.
* Fix #197: When one of our MU plugin was created on plugin deactivation, it triggered a fatal error, it was so fatal that we decided to remove it.

* New #160: Add a filter named `secupress.remote_timeout` if you got too many "Pending" status in scanner, add more timeout since cUrl is not always gentle with us ><
